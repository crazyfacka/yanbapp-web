# yanbapp-web

Little budget app used as a learning platform for Vue.js 2. It is working but quite some features are missing. It is largely based on the YNAB Budgeting app.
There is the companion server side application found at https://github.com/crazyfacka/yanbapp-api

## Running notes

When running the application, it launches an nginx server so that you can have both applications running locally and have the backend respond on the /api path.
